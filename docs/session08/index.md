> Snake on the grid.

> Now that grid movement has been established we need to consider how to construct a snake on the grid. You can think of a snake as a list of points in order. Every time the snake head moves the previous head needs to be added to the body. Every time the print loop runs, print ever segment in the body and print the head.
